# MBC05_Work-Day-Scheduler


Monash Bootcamp Week 5 Assignment - Workday Scheduler

### About this project

This simple calendar application allows an employee to add events to a daily work planner for time managment. 

The schedule has defined business hours (9AM -5PM).  On entry, color coding has been used so that the employee can easily identify records in the past, the current hour based on their local time
and scheduled future events.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
